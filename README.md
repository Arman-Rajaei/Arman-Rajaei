# Hi, I'm Arman 👋

I'm a **Signal Processing & Machine Learning Engineer** with a strong background in  
**biomedical imaging, numerical algorithms, and high-performance data processing**.

My work focuses on building **end-to-end pipelines** — from raw signals to reliable, interpretable results.

## 🔬 What I work on

- Digital signal processing (FFT, wavelets, filtering, denoising)
- Biomedical signal analysis (SNA, physiological time-series)
- Spectral-domain OCT reconstruction and 3D volume processing  
- Numerical modeling and optimization
- Python, MATLAB, C++, CUDA-accelerated workflows
